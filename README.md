The LEDs connected to the Arduino represent quantum states.

Setup: LED1, long leg to Pin 9(or any other analog pin, change the code), short leg to resistor(220-500 Ohm) to ground,

LED2, long leg to Pin 11(or any other analog pin, change the code), short leg to the resistor.

The 2qubitsim program simulates two qubits with the LEDs, and there are functions like X gate(not gate), entanglement, superposition, and measurement. The other one is just me getting the hang of Arduino with a more simple program. The other programs' descriptions can be seen in their respective commit messages.
